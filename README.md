DroidSheep [ROOT]

What is this about?
-------------------

If you know Firesheep or Faceniff, you probably know what this is about – OpenSource one-click session hijacking using your android smartphone or tablet computer.

DroidSheep demonstrates how easy an attack like this can be – Just start DroidSheep, click the START button and wait until someone uses one of the supported websites. Jumping on his session simply needs one more click. That´s it.

Although DroidSheep is not made for doing such attacks, anyone can test and assure that it really works. For the ones who are interested in how this works, there is the source code public available (see download section).
